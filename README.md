# advent-of-code-ruby

Working through the advent of code problems with Ruby.

Naming conventions: 
- 2-digit day of the month followed by file extension: `.rb` for solution, `.txt` for input
  - inputs should be located in the `inputs` directory inside the relevant year directory
- solution should consist of two functions: `part_one` and `part_two`, which accept year and day string params

To run:
```bash
$ bin/run {year} {day}
```

e.g.
```bash
$ bin/run 2021 01
```
